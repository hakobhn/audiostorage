## Testing strategy

Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application to identify if it meets specified requirements and to identify any defects. The following are common testing strategies:

* Black box testing – Tests the functionality of the software without looking at the internal code structure.
* White box testing – Tests the internal code structure and logic of the software.
* Unit testing – Tests individual units or components of the software to ensure they are functioning as intended.
* Integration testing – Tests the integration of different components of the software to ensure they work together as a system.
* Functional testing – Tests the functional requirements of the software to ensure they are met.
* System testing – Tests the complete software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
* Acceptance testing – Tests the software to ensure it meets the customer’s or end-user’s expectations.
* Regression testing – Tests the software after changes or modifications have been made to ensure the changes have not introduced new defects.
* Performance testing – Tests the software to determine its performance characteristics such as speed, scalability, and stability.
* Security testing – Tests the software to identify vulnerabilities and ensure it meets security requirements.
